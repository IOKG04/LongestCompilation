# Longest Compilation

> Some code that will eventually compile to a program that prints "Hello world!" to the screen.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to this masterpiece, here are the rules you have to know:  
- The program must still compile if `make` is run in the `src` directory
- The compiled program must print "Hello world!" and a new line character (`\n` or `0xA`) to stdout once run
- The compiled program must be called `HelloWorld` and must not be an interpreter
- The addition must be interesting and not a simple *I added the source files of [known compiler] and set it to compile that here* or similar
- The compilation program must take longer than before your adition and the time it takes must be deterministic (not rely on random variables)

The last point I'll probably test on my machine too, though it would still be appreciated if you made sure it is faster on your system first, so I'm not wasting time.
